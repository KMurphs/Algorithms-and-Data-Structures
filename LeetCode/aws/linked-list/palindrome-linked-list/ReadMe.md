Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome.

 

Example 1:
![Example](./Example.jpg)
```
Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
Output: true
```
Example 2:
![Example](./Example1.jpg)
```
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: false
```

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
